# SimplePlatformer
A simple platformer using PyGame.

Includes basic powerups; monsters that will target the player, and a randomly generated level. The background moves in a "parallax" manner using different speeds for each of the layers.

Uses the pickle library to save game data.

*(Excuse the poor quality of the self-made art)*
